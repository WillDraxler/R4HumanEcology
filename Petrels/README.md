This folder was a bit of a detour to look at some code written by Elenor Gnam for Autumn Pauly's petrel work. I was helping Autumn work through it a bit, but I didn't end up doing much other than reading it. I certainally got plenty out of simply reading the code though, it is very well done. Much of it doesn't run due to my lack of a .csv file
